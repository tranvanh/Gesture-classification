As mentioned in \nameref{ch:introduction} chapter, we would want to evaluate the recognition performance based on a number of connected LMC sensors. We mainly focused on the overall placement of sensors and their field of view., having a single connected sensor as a reference field of view and exploring its expansion using different layouts with a different number of connected sensors. 

We used the demo application and trained model as described in section \ref{real_time_recognition} section. The model was trained on original dataset using sampling process from section \ref{handicrafted_dataset}. The dataset consists of 7 static gestures (fist, 1-pointing, 2-peace sign, 3, 4, 5-open fist, pinch) and 2 dynamic gestures(swipe left, swipe right). Each gesture consists of average 370 samples.
