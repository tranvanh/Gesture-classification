As mentioned in \nameref{ch:introduction} chapter, we would also want to evaluate the recognition performance based on a number of connected LMC sensors. We mainly focused on the overall placement of sensors and their field of view., having a single connected sensor as a reference field of view and exploring its expansion using different layouts with a different number of connected sensors.
