An \textbf{artificial neural network (ANN)} is a mathematical model mimicking biological neural networks,
namely their ability to learn and correct errors from previous experience.\cite{designimplentationcc}\cite{bengio2017deep} 

The ANN subject was first introduced by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts in "A logical calculus of the ideas immanent in nervous activity" published in 1943.\cite{mcculloch1943logical} But it was not until recent years when ANN has gained popularity with still increasing advancements in technology and availability of training data. ANN had become one of the default solutions for complex tasks which were previously thought to be unsolvable by computers.\cite{neural2016krishtopa}

This chapter will briefly explore different types of neural units and their activation functions, along with some exemplary network architectures.
