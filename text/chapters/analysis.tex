One of them being Microsoft Kinect, a device where the main intention was to interpret whole-body movement, making it lacking in required accuracy for hand gesture recognition. 

Another option would be using a Leap Motion Controller, developed specifically to track hand movements and extract its features, such as positions of fingers, hand rotation, and others. Its accuracy in finger detection is up to 0.01 mm.

Unfortunately, Leap Motion Controller has no official library for gesture recognition, limiting developers from utilizing the controller for its key features. Orion used to have a gesture detector with its 3.0 version, but the detector is absent with the release of more accurate version 4.0.
