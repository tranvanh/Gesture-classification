Feed-forward network (FNN) has its data or input travel in one direction, oriented from the input layer to the output layer, without cycles.\cite{6typeann}
FNN may or may not contain several hidden layers of various widths. By having no back-loops, FNN generally minimizes error in its prediction by using the backpropagation algorithm to update its weight values.

The input layer takes input data, vector x, producing y at the output layer. The process of training weights
 consists of minimizing the loss function L(y,y), y being the target output of input x.\cite{lipton2015critical}
