Perceptron is the simplest class of artificial neurons developed by Frank Rosenblatt in 1958.\cite{perceptronprobabmodel}

Perceptron takes several binary inputs, vector $\vec{x} = (x_1, x_2,...,x_n)$, and outputs a single binary number. To express the importance of respected input edges, perceptron uses real numbers called weights, assigned to each edge, vector $\vec{w} = (w_1,w_2,...,w_n)$.

A step function calculates the perceptron's output.
The function output is either 0 or 1 determined by whether its weighted sum $\alpha = \sum_{i} x_i w_i$ is less or greater than its threshold value, a real number, usually represented as an incoming edge with a negative weight -1.

\begin{equation}
    output =
\begin{cases}
    1, & \text{if $\alpha\ \geq\ threshold$}\\
    0, & \text{if $\alpha\ <\ threshold$}
\end{cases} 
\end{equation}
