Perceptron is the simplest class of artificial neurons developed by Frank Rosenblatt in 1958.\cite{perceptronprobabmodel} Perceptron takes several binary inputs, vector x = (x1, x2,...,xn), and outputs a single binary number. To express the importance of respected input edges, perceptron uses real numbers called weights, assigned to each edge, vector w = (w1,w2,...,wn).

A step function calculates the perceptron's output.
The function output is either 0 or 1 determined by whether its weighted sum w (SUM) is less or greater than its threshold value, a real number, usually represented as an incoming edge with a negative weight -1.
