Sigmoid neuron, similarly to perceptron, has inputs x and weights. The key difference comes in once we inspect the output value and its calculation.
 Instead of perceptron's binary output 0 or 1, a sigmoid neuron outputs a real number between 0 and 1 using a sigmoid function. \newline

As shown in Figure xx and Figure xx, the sigmoid function is a smoothed-out version of the step function.\\
