Sigmoid neuron, similarly to perceptron, has inputs x and weights. The key difference comes in once we inspect the output value and its calculation. Instead of perceptron's binary output 0 or 1, a sigmoid neuron outputs a real number between 0 and 1 using a sigmoid function.\cite{nndl2015michaelnielsen}\cite{rojas2013neural}

As shown in Figure xx and Figure xx, the sigmoid function is a smoothed-out version of the step function.
