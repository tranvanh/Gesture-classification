  abstract = {Advancement in technology has opened new ways in the field of Human Machine Interaction. A Novel method for recognition of American Sign Language (ASL) is proposed using Leap Motion Sensor. Static signs (A to Z and numbers from 1 to 10) excluding J and Z are used for processing. However 2 and 6 also excluded from dataset as the posture of these is similar to V and W respectively. Features Set consist of positional values (fingers and palm), distance and angle values. Total 48 features are used to recognize ASL using Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) which is a feed forward artificial neural network. Dataset consists of 146 users who have performed 32 signs resulting in total dataset of 4672 signs. Out of this 90% dataset is used for training and 10% dataset is used for CV (Cross Validation)/testing. The average classification accuracy obtained is near about 90%.},

  abstract="Defining methods for the automatic understanding of gestures is of paramount importance in many application contexts and in Virtual Reality applications for creating more natural and easy-to-use human-computer interaction methods. In this paper, we present a method for the recognition of a set of non-static gestures acquired through the Leap Motion sensor. The acquired gesture information is converted in color images, where the variation of hand joint positions during the gesture are projected on a plane and temporal information is represented with color intensity of the projected points. The classification of the gestures is performed using a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). A modified version of the popular ResNet-50 architecture is adopted, obtained by removing the last fully connected layer and adding a new layer with as many neurons as the considered gesture classes. The method has been successfully applied to the existing reference dataset and preliminary tests have already been performed for the real-time recognition of dynamic gestures performed by users.",
